<img src=»articles/art_chagall.jpg» title=»Marc Chagall Art» width=»301» height=»324» alt=»Marc Chagall Art» /><strong>Marc Chagall</strong> (1887-1985) is a well-known Belarusian-born French painter and designer, distinguished for his surrealistic inventiveness. He is recognized as one of the most significant painters and graphic artists of the 20<sup>th</sup> century.

Chagall was born July 7, 1887, in Vitebsk, Belarus (Віцебск, Беларусь). The eldest of nine chidren in a poor Jewish family, Chagall passed his childhood steeped in Hasidic culture. With his mother's support, and despite his father's disapproval, Chagall pursued his interest in art. His first teacher was Belarusian-born Jewish painter Yehuda Pen.

Marc Chagall writes in his book <strong>My Life</strong>:  *»I learned about Pen when I was riding on a tram. I was crossing the Cathedral Square and I saw a signboard – white letters on blue: «Artist Pen's School.» «What a cultured city is our Vitebsk,» I thought.* «

Chagall pursued his interest in art, going to St. Petersburg in 1907 to study art with Leon Bakst. Influenced by contemporary Russian painting, Chagall's distinctive, child-like style, often centering on images from his childhood in Belarus, began to emerge.

In 1910, he moved to Paris, where he associated, among others, with Guillaume Apollinaire (a famous French poet who also has some Belarusian roots). It was during this period that Chagall painted some of his most famous paintings of the Jewish shtetl or village, and developed the features that became recognizable trademarks of his art. Strong and often bright colors portray the world with a dreamlike, non-realistic simplicity, and the fusion of fantasy, religion, and nostalgia infuses his work with a joyous quality. Animals, workmen, lovers, and musicians populate his figures; the «fiddler on the roof» recurs frequently, often hovering within another scene.

In 1914, before the outbreak of World War I, Chagall held a one-man show in Berlin. During WWI, he resided in Belarus, and in 1917, endorsing the revolution, he was appointed Commissar for Fine Arts in Vitebsk and then director of the newly established Free Academy of Art. He became involved in ambitious projects for a local academy, but he left after two and a half years in order to escape the revolutionary dictates of Malevich. After a stay in Moscow, where he worked in the Jewish theatre, then in Berlin, where he studied the technique of engraving, he returned to Paris in 1923.

In 1944 the artist's wife Bella died. During Chagall's exile in New York, he designed the costumes and stage decorations for a ballet performance of Igor Stravinsky's The Firebird. In 1946, the New York Museum of Modern Art had a huge retrospective exhibition of Marc Chagall's prints and paintings. The exhibition was a big success and was later shown in Chicago.

Chagall painted with a variety of media, such as oils, water colors, and gouaches. His work also expanded to other forms of art, including ceramics, mosaics, and stained glass. Among his most famous building decorations are the ceiling of the Opera House in Paris, murals at the New York Metropolitan Opera, a glass window at the United Nations, and decorations at the Vatican. Chagall received many prizes and much recognition for his work. He was also one of very few artists to exhibit work at the Louvre in their lifetime.
