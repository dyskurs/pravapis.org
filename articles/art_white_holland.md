After more than 10 years since Belarus has gained its independence most of the English-speaking writers, journalists and even webmasters have learned to <a href="articles/art_belarus_name.html">call our country by its proper name</a> and even use the correct adjective: Belarusian or Belarusan (check out <a href="http://www.belarus-misc.org/bel-one.htm">this page with background information</a> on using this adjective in English).


Alas, the Germans with the irrational stubbornness continue to call our country "White Russia," and our language the "White Russian." Ten+ years was not enough for them? Well, I am weary of waiting--the time is up. From now on, in all of my writings, speeches and conversations I will refer to Germany exclusively as "White Netherlands" or "White Holland." Also I will dub the German language as "White Dutch."


After all, calling  *ze*  Germans "White Dutch" makes so much more sense than calling Belarus by the name of our historical external enemy ( *der Todfeind* ) which brought us so much suffering and death in the last 600 years. If the Germans enjoy being so weirdly creative, I can also suggest to their linguists calling Albanian "White Serbia", Pakistan "White India", Ireland "White England", and Israel "White Palestine."


Examples of usage:<br />
 The White Dutch poet Goethe<br />
 The White Holland government of Helmut Kohl<br />
 Berlin, the White Dutch capital<br />
