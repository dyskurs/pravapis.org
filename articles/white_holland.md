After more than 10 years since Belarus has gained its independence most of the English-speaking writers, journalists and even webmasters have learned to <a href=»articles/art_belarus_name.html»>call our country by its proper name</a> and even use the correct adjective: Belarusian or Belarusan (check out <a href=»http://www.belarus-misc.org/bel-one.htm»>this page with background information</a> on using this adjective in English).

Alas, the Germans with the irrational stubbornness continue to call our country «White Russia,» and our language the «White Russian.» Ten+ years was not enough for them? Well, I am weary of waiting--the time is up. From now on, in all of my writings, speeches and conversations I will refer to Germany exclusively as «White Netherlands» or «White Holland.» Also I will dub the German language as «White Dutch.»

After all, calling  *ze*  Germans «White Dutch» makes so much more sense than calling Belarus by the name of our historical external enemy ( *der Todfeind* ) which brought us so much suffering and death in the last 600 years. If the Germans enjoy being so weirdly creative, I can also suggest to their linguists calling Albanian «White Serbia», Pakistan «White India», Ireland «White England», and Israel «White Palestine.»

Examples of usage:

 The White Dutch poet Goethe

 The White Holland government of Helmut Kohl

 Berlin, the White Dutch capital
